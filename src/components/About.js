                            I graduated from the <strong>University of British Columbia</strong> with a Bachelors of Commerce with a combined major in Computer Science and Business. I'm passionate about a career that involves working on innovative projects that bring talented people together to create meaningful impact.

                            Iâ€™m all about being open-minded and embracing new challenges and opportunities. My internships have given me the chance to explore diverse roles across tech and business, enhancing my problem-solving skills and adaptability.

                            <br></br>
                            When I'm not immersed in my work, you can find me biking, hiking, lifting weights, or trying new restaurants around Vancouver.
