                            Iâ€™m passionate about being open-minded and embracing new challenges and opportunities. Recently, my internships allowed me to explore various roles in both tech and business, enhancing my problem-solving and adaptability skills.

                            Outside of work, I enjoy biking, hiking, lifting weights, and trying out new restaurants around the city.
